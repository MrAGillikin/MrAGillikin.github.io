		<h3>Whole Brain Paragraph:</h3>
		<p>One of my passion projects is a tactical-rpg game about building up a ship of refugees into a sustainable civilization in a dangerous world. On the logical side, this involves creating and refining the rules of gameplay, and making sure they work properly. On the creative side, it involves creating the world, it's history, and it's dangers - and making enjoyable characters and setpieces. The project is long-term, but I'm sure there is an audience for it.</p>
		<h3>Golden Circle:</h3>
		<p>
			What: I am a coder with experience in several languages, simple program creation, and website design.
			How:
			Why: To earn money and create my own projects. And because I believe in technology's advancement and self-improvement.

		<h3>Elevator Pitch:</h3>

		<h3>Weekly Reflections:</h3>
		<h4>Week 1</h4>
		<p>I was nervous about a lot of things this first week. More than the subject material, I was worried about being crushed under the schedule and projets - both are at a scale I haven't seen before. So far, I seem to be adjusting alright. The material is interesting, and I seem to be getting along well with the other people. I should work on taking better notes going forward - the class materials on slack and bootcamp-coders aren't easy to navigate.</p>
		<h4>Week 2</h4>
